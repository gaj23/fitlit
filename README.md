## Introduction

Designed with desktop and mobile viewing in mind, our variation of FitLit provides a simplicity of design that doesn't interfere with user data display.

This project was set forth by Turing School of Software and Design with specific parameters to be met. The current iteration (as of 2020/12/17) fulfills up to iteration 4 as outlined in the [rubric](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/fitlit.html). Our team paid close attention to responsive design, thorough testing, DRY SRP coding by utilizing an additional helper file.

## Reflections

### Team Work
For this project, both of us expressed how we felt our communication was clear and often. This allowed for us to feel comfortable divving up responsibilities to manage the time difference that existed between us. Additionally, if any problems arose or questions arose, there was no hesitiation to reach out.

### Future Iterations

More specifics about future work or refactoring can be found in our [GH Issues](https://github.com/gaj23/fitlit/issues) page, but in general:
- Implement [Chart.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chart.js) for easier to read weekly data display
- Add in a friend view for a user.
- Drag and drop widgets depending on a user's preference.

*If testing:*
Start by installing npm with `npm install` in your terminal. Followed by uncommenting line 1 of the Class files. This line requires `helper.js` so when node is run, the Classes have access to the helper and doesn't throw any issues. __When testing is complete__ remember to comment out line 1. If it remains, it breaks our browser experience and throws errors in the console.
This is a noted issue with no other work around.

Thank you in advance for your input!
